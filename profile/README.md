# ASCII Mentorship Program

Dear Students,

Greetings from **ASCII**, the CSIS Dept. Student Body. 
We are pleased to invite you to the ASCII Mentorship Programme. This mentorship programme is structured to give students an opportunity to work with their seniors on various projects in an academic setting.

The focal point of each mentorship group will be a practical project headed by a Mentor. This mentorship program is aimed toward 2nd-year and 3rd-year students who wish to explore certain domains in Computer Science in a guided fashion. You will be working on top-notch projects headed by 4th-year students who have worked in the same fields, which will give you hands-on practical exposure and further your understanding of various domains in computer science.

Most of the projects also have a faculty supervisor. Hence, this programme is an excellent opportunity to connect and build working relationships with seniors and faculty. The project can also help you get selected for SOPs later under the corresponding faculty since they will already have some experience in the relevant areas. 
However, the mentorship group is more than just the project and is also a guidance forum for students interested in CS.
